# 100 Days Of ML Code - Example Log

### Day 0: July 21,2018

**Today's Progress**:Started reading keras documentation found link on keras resource on github

**Thoughts:** I think keras is easier to understand and use as compared to pytorch or tensorflow

**Link to work:** [Keras resources github](https://github.com/anandpawara/keras-resources)<br>
learned about Keras Sequential Model  [here](https://keras.io/models/sequential/)<br>

### Day 1: July 22,2018
**Today's Progress**: Learning about google colab for deploying model <br>
Finished with examples in keras Sequential from [here](https://keras.io/models/sequential/)<br>

**Thoughts**:Kera examples were good for practice for beginners and had good explanations but could not find any good resource for loading data to google drive and to use with google colab

**Link(s) to work**
[Word done on](www.github.com/anandpawara/)

### Day 2: July 21,2018

**Today's Progress**:Started reading keras documentation found link on keras resource on github and reading from book -Deep learning with python by Francis Challot and doing exercises from section Convnet

**Thoughts:** Good explanation and intiutive understanding about CNN concepts .

**Link to work:** [Keras resources github](https://github.com/anandpawara/keras-resources)<br>
learned about Keras Sequential Model  [here](https://keras.io/models/sequential/)<br>

### Day 3: July 23,2018
**Today's Progress**: building CNN from scrath on DogsvsCats on kaggle dataset <br>
Done with data augmentation and visualization [here]

### Day 4: July 24,2018
**Today's Progress**: Deployed my first model image classification model on google colab<br>
Finished with examples in keras Sequential from [here](https://keras.io/models/sequential/)<br>

**Thoughts**:Deploying model on google colab is very trouble some as it is very download and load data onto model but somehow managed to get it done right

### Day 5: July 26,2018
**Today's Progress**: Building first CNN model from scrath <br>
Finished with examples in keras Sequential from [here](https://keras.io/models/sequential/)<br>

**Thoughts**:Building models in keras very compared to pytorch or tensorflow and learnt about data processing and data augmentation and fine tuning and how to overcome overfitting

### Day 6: July 27,2018
**Today's Progress**: Trying to Neural style transfer <br>
Awesome video implementing Neural style transfer from fast.ai[here](https://keras.io/models/sequential/)<br>

**Thoughts**:Ran into some error while running fast.ai module so have to write my own code on neural style transfer<br>
