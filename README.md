# 100 Days Of ML Code - Example Log

### Day 0: July 21,2018

**Today's Progress**:Started reading keras documentation found link on keras resource on github

**Thoughts:** I think keras is easier to understand and use as compared to pytorch or tensorflow

**Link to work:** [Keras resources github](https://github.com/anandpawara/keras-resources)<br>
learned about Keras Sequential Model  [here](https://keras.io/models/sequential/)<br>

### Day 1: July 22,2018
**Today's Progress**: Learning about google colab for deploying model <br>
Finished with examples in keras Sequential from [here](https://keras.io/models/sequential/)<br>

**Thoughts**:Kera examples were good for practice for beginners and had good explanations but could not find any good resource for loading data to google drive and to use with google colab

### Day 2: July 21,2018

**Today's Progress**:Started reading keras documentation found link on keras resource on github and reading from book -Deep learning with python by Francis Challot and doing exercises from section Convnet

**Thoughts:** Good explanation and intiutive understanding about CNN concepts .
